cade9e425d75948e,"Agent X2: Basically thanks - with a 'little' more 

(Little has to be a bit more in this case. It just lies in the nature of the matter.)

First: English is not my native language, so I won't correct the article myself. I rely on others to do that for me, based on my suggestions. Again, I am a german dissident and as a man with a technical background, I do not only have years-long experience with most probably driving around a hidden GPS/GSM bug and the consequences of this arrangement. I also have the ability to become aware of it, although I have to rely on many 'strange observations' which after months of further observation and consideration start to make sense, if you explain them the way I have.

I had prepared a comprehensive letter yesterday summarizing the present situation of the article - i e before your recent changes. For ease of work, let me copy and paste it here, erasing only the sentences that have no more meaning at all. The rest therefore is still true, more or less:

First, I'm not quite sure what implications the 'Articles lacking sources'
classification has. There sure is a lot more to say and show about this
subject, but I think it is already now safe to say that we've got a case. So
what about removing it from this kind of probably discriminatory category? I
suspect that presently it looks like a kind of 'crackpot' article and
therefore doesn't really invite others to join. Would there be a more
suitable 'wanted' category?

Second, we do agree that these appliances exist, and that they also can be
abused. Experience tells you, if something can be abused, it also will.
Experience also tells you, that government agencies are no exception when it
comes to this kind of things. What we need are more details about their (i e
the presumed LEC = military version) size, sensitivity (with respect to the
concealed places they can be attached to) and battery life-span (assuming
they're not installed, just stuck with a magnet or some dough-type
fastener). In the discussion, I gave the URL of a leading german maker of
these objects and tried to draw your attention to the fact that their folder
directed to the LEC is password-protected *), while the material for the
general market is on open display. Would that ring a bell with you?

Third, I would like to see several changes in the article. I'll enumerate
and motivate them in a separate message - see below.

Fourth, I'd like to join everybody into the discussion who is interested in
this subject and can contribute something reasonable (or maybe knows someone
who can). My idea is, this is not just an electronic gadget issue, this is a
civil rights concern. Do you see any other faculties involved, besides
electronics and human rights? How do we spread the word among them? Again,
we need to remove all the discriminatory  classifications from the article
for others to join.

) For your convenience, let me quote that sentence: 'Have you especially
seen my remark regarding the password-protected folder at
http://www.fugon.de/ , expressively directed towards the german LEC ('BOS')?
Wouldn't you agree that this most probably is where all the REALLY
INTERESTING stuff could be found?!? Enigma...'

Third: Desired changes to the article

Foreword: ok

Types of GPS trackers:

I've been informed that they don't necessarily limit temselves to SMS, when
transmitting. Another option would probably be to use GPRS - one of the
wider used packet-switched data transmission modes in cellphone systems.

It is also here that we ought to mention that they are used for tracking
down criminals. I've sent you proof of that. See the discussion page where I
quoted the two media article discussing the german constitutional court's
verdict on GPS/GSM bugs dating back to 4/05.

It ought to be mentioned in that same chapter that there is reason to
believe that there also exist more 'professional' versions for the use
through the military, LEC etc, which are probably smaller, more sensitive
(can be placed 'anywhere' and still work, without external antennas) and
have a long battery life-span.

Potential abuse of GPS trackers:

What is said in the box is basically correct. Could it be re-formulated in a
way to provoke people's interest, rather than stir a feeling for lack of
trustworthiness? Something along the line that 'these are military-style
secrets thus hard to ascertain; anyone from inside this business having
doubts about their ultimate legitimacy should feel invited to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

Hi Bine mai, namibnut again about uranium. I am slowly figuring out how things work, so apologies if this is the wrong way to address these issues. After reading about Aussinanis and writing a message to you, I clicked on the Uranium mines in Namibia link and now realize you have made all the entries there. May I point out some detail that might just be important as far as Wikipedia is concerned. There is a major distinction between a mine and an exploration project. Currently only Rössing, Langer Heinrich, Trekkopje and Husab can be called mines. Husab is in the process of construction, so one can call it a mine. Valencia is called a mine because there is a signboard on the road that says """"Valencia mine"""", but they never advanced beyond the mid-exploration phase. The reality is that none of the other projects are further than advanced exploration. Even Trekkopje is technically still constructing, but have actually shut down because of the poor economy. Some of the Reptile projects (e.g. Omahola) and Zhonge Resources have received mining licences but it is unlikely that they will be developed soon; the uranium price is far too low for economical extraction and will remain like that for some time to come.

0cc5e89357e6d1be,"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

Good morning dear Admin, 

User:Lagoo Sab is a sockpuppet of User:Ketabtoon. I contacted him through a just created account and his email and introduced myself as one of his allies and talked with him about the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara editwars here on Wikipedia and told him I would support him against infidel Hazaras and sellout Tajiks. In return he told me creating at least two accounts and use them alternating. Further, he said between both account´s usage should be at least 3month break for not beeing identified as sockpuppet. He himself told me Ketabtoon is another account of him which is used on his cousins computer. Now it´s your duty as admin and guard of Wikipedia´s policy to do something against him.

c594b9c35e80e7d0,"OK...you all call my behavior 'aggressive,' but I consider it WP:BOLD. You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: """"This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks""""  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should """"accept the rules"""" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.

Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,"""" but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.

When I wrote """"Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit..."""" in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said """"White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...""""  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.

Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.

Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.""""

8563461b0d2ff4fd,"I heard you like hamburgers. 

  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.

History
Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said """"Lone Jogger"""". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.

He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar """"robble robble."""" In """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"""" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.
Hamburglar 2015
In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Headline text 
Attention: Sandra [[User:69.11.10.188|

When indicating """"passing"""" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:

1)What do you mean by """"passing"""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"enforce"""" these requirements?

2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these """"passing"""" grades?  Your """"grades"""" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"required"""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"requirement"""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"blind trust"""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip """"grades"""" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  
 
Example: 

NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org""""
      AND
ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  """"
      AND
TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.
 
4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.

If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.

Thank you very kindly. M.Dùfy

...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  

Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. 

Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.

At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...

d6572c95c6626e3f,"Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase
First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as """"lessons"""" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

165c7d6afba4dec3,"Dbinder, you asked if someone could verify those possible future regional members... well, if someone really could they wouldn't be possible future members but future members....

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please improve the article by negotiating NPOV wording in the Talk section rather than by serial reverting.  If  the material violates WP:BLP or is libelous, so that the #RR does not apply, then reverts made to enforce this provision are generally not considered contentious.

Hello Ben. May I start by noting that you have not attended to a single point I have made, but merely made unfounded protestations without any factual evidence to back them; please write all sources and proof if you have a factual point to make? These reverts to the long-standing article were not my writings, they were edits back to a well-accepted compromise (a fact you surreptitiously ignore), and the main text has been in an approved state for months now. Two separate administrators are happily with its compromise from both sides, but you appear to think you can smash in here like a bull in a china store, and rearrange the whole lot based on your own religious biases and PR campaigns for the Watchtower org. As I kindly pointed out Ben, please read all the talk pages, yes all 14 of them before you do any more vandalizing, and make casual unfounded accusations. These subjects have been debated many times and a common compromise was reached months ago, which you appear clearly not interested in. Your selfishness in trying to destroy the hard work of others and their extensive debates on these matters is quite typical of many with your religious background (the blinkered view that any method is acceptable if it makes the JWs look good in the public eye). Censorship is not welcome here, especially when it has a blatant religious agenda and bias. You have failed to make a single point of valid criticism that has not been discussed at great length before (please go and read all 14 pages of talk) as you might start to understand why you are being so unreasonable and astoundingly narrow-minded. Wikipedia is here for factual information, not public relation promotions for religious sects; if you want that then go to the Watchtower's website. If you have a specific point with referenced proof and backup, then bring it here and discuss it, but please check it has not already been done before, and please don't come out with more nebulous vague accusation with no specific point or proof. If you have facts you feel are incorrect, then produce your documented proof with references, then it can be discussed here in a mature way, before any possible changes are made.

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC).

( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

12c0565fb96caa5a,"Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In other words, those who are apt to point fingers at others and label them as conservatives are likely not only wrong but also liberals.

We needn't include a whole sentence on the matter, however, or give it undue weight. For instance, we could go for something along the lines of: """"Some individuals, termed """"the Internet's self-appointed vigilantes"""" in The Washington Post, subsequently doxed and harassed Carla via her Facebook account """"in revenge"""" for Leelah's death,[55] with Spiked journalist Brendan O'Neill comparing their behavior to that of the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church.""""

In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what """"make him notable"""". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized. 
The truth is, being a 32nd degree Mason is not that noteworthy... any 3rd degree Mason can become one... all it takes is paying an initiation fee, and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play.  In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.  
As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.

Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.

5db73cb28e44afe6,"Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quite on the contrary, the TV crews were confined behind a fence. This was all deliberate distortion. I think that a person must be really mentally deficient not to be able to understand this point.

Hello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:
 
""""The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) ."""" 

I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? 

I ask, of course, because you are a """"relatively famous Wikipedian"""" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

My opinion on these pages is uneducated mods deleted them for invalid reasons with NO DEBATE, a pure Draconian nazi mod behavior.

The 8 Prime Spirals article is a BIG DEAL in math since it puts forth amazing information about a 1995 math theory now being used in real life computer programs to outperform all the prime algorithms wiki has pages on.

So in the world of primality IT IS A BIG DEAL.

Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.    ♦ ♣ ♠ 
I'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.   
Sir - my """"history of edit warring"""" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of """"editor"""" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.    
This looks like a bad block, and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin. Is there any """"history/involvement"""" per say with the blocking admin?   
WRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me"""" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not """"edit war"""" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone """"thinks"""" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.

Thanks for the kind words. 

I've found that most of the greatest writers of all languages are unworkable here on Wikipedia; Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Brontes, Lev Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Gustave Flaubert, etc will never be GA or FA (or if they make it somehow, they will never retain it). I'm sure it took a huge effort to get Chekhov to FA, though the article seems to have been given a bit of a break on quality requirements for some reason or other. 

One of my biggest problems is the eternally unfinished state of Wikipedia. Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, and 100s of other articles used to be GA or FA, but they were demoted because editing is left open after an article is promoted, allowing them to be destroyed by """"average"""" editors if there aren't vigilant babysitters watching. The other thing is that lovers of classic literature will usually find more info on their own out of a deep and abiding interest about writers and works than could ever be made available here. So who are we writing these literary articles for? A true reader will search things out like an Antiquary, and how many of those use Wikipedia as a reference? When it comes to writing articles on individual works, I favor reading the works themselves, rather than some trifle of an article, even if it's """"scholarly"""". I won't even start on the strange pseudo-government and society of Wikipedia, the invitation into which I must've misplaced.

fe44358688a962b6,"Aztec dreadlocks?

Tentatively removed:

Dreadlocks were also part of Mexican culture. In a description of an Aztec ritual, Historian William Hickling Prescott referred to dreadlocked Priests of the Aztec civilization, a Mesoamerican people of central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th century. """"On the summit he was received by six priests, whose long and matted locks flowed disorderly over their sable robes, covered with hieroglyphic scrolls of mystic import. They led him to the sacrificial stone, a huge block of jasper, with its upper surface somewhat convex."""" (William H. Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico)

The Aztecs may, indeed, have worn dreadlocks.  However, the quote provided refers to only """"matted locks,"""" which certainly are not the same as dreads.  A bad case of """"bed-head"""" is not dreadlocks.  I've searched the Internet for """"Aztec dreadlocks"""" and came up with zilch.

6. Princeton, NJ
7. Annapolis, MD
8. Trenton, NJ
9. New York, NY
10. Philadelphia
11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

""""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""""

Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".  

Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk.

Please if you are going to block someone in the future please look into BOTH sides.  The trenton ontario page is incorrect and it will stay that way until you stop siding with Blotto Adrift.  This is not the only page users have complained about Blotto adrift changing.  I am here to help wikipedia by correcting mistakes.  This will only improve this sites poor view.  However if admins do not look into the actions of all users this site will only go down hill.  Blocking based on providing correct information is sad.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 69.157.65.118

Interesting
Greetings. According to your contribution history[1], the only edit you have made before today was to Rush last July. You have never edited Trenton nor any other article to do with places in Canada so what are talking about? Malcolmxl5 (talk) 

hmmm.... I did last week before I was blocked. 

anyways I would like the trenton ontario page to be corrected.  Please do a search on scholars portal to find the several journal articals by J.Mickelakos.... then Blotto will say how do we know he's from trenton?  

It is sad that one of the only scholars this town has is not added because of the jealousy a user has when someone corrects his edits 

Protecting Blotto adrift
You will find every way to protect Blotto adrift instead of correcting an error on a page.  I am here to help wikipedia and you seem not interested in this. 

Like I said before, he is sited in many journals.  Also scholar portal has over 500 000 journals google  less than 1000, so how is he to be sourced?  Also please see York's part time professor list in tthe calendar. 

That's 'cited', not 'sited', by the way. Happy days.   

I will await your apology – and the apology from others Thank you

how about you correct wikipedia, because I can find many typos on your page

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer. 

I will strongly suggest you moved the page back to Luis Miguel and create another Luis Miguel (disambiguation) page.

Regarding the [Wikipedia,_bicycles,_and_wagons] reference, its my understanding that I am building a bicycle, that may be slightly off spec, and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell, instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec.

Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed.  To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups.

O'Brien is another primary source, she doesn't work for the OED, or any of the usual places we go to when we want an authorative answer to when terms originated. Also O'Brien does not directly credit Lambert so even this source doesn't directly support the article text.

I'll tell you right now, if we don't see significantly more response, your idea, regardless of its merits, isn't going anywhere.  A way must be found to increase participation.   
There's no way to force someone to participate, mediation in itself is voluntary. It might be a good idea to send another round of notifications, but this time, with wording that encourages them to add their opinion eg """"A proposal has been made to rename the two abortion articles to completely new names"""". The idea, which is located at Link, is currently open for opinions. Your thoughts on the matter would be appreciated"""" or something like that anyway. That should hopefully kick the discussion up a gear.  The clock is ticking.... 
I think giving some additional exposure to that discussion is a good idea. But personally I think the matter is likely to have been settled which is why I haven't made any further points. Unless there is a big change in opinion after 30 days you should just move the articles to their new titles.    
The issue is mentioned on the abortion-rights talk page, but notifying involved parties (as listed on the mediation talk page) might be a wise move to take.  The clock is ticking.... 
I did that as soon as that list was made.    
Sure, but it might be wise to post them a reminder like the one I recommended.  The clock is ticking.... 
Fair enough.    

Well, between Eraserhead and I, I think it's safe to say that every single editor who touched either of those two pages over the past year has been notified. We'll just have to see what happens.   
Well, the input has certainly increased significantly. Good luck to you sorting out all the opinions.  No rush, though.  I think you should wait at least a month before deciding anything.   
Indeed, input has increased. I think letting discussion car",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

However I believe that JamesJJames has launched a personal attack on myself. I do note his comments are generally aggressive(see contribs) and his approach is destructive(deleting, criticising) rather than constructive in the sense of putting things on WP.
I believe my article on Golden Age of Cricket was sound and I wonder if JamesJJames could point out any factual errors. It was a work in progress. I note that it was not passed for deletion ny peer review.

I only asked you if you blame Poland for all German losses. I did not claim knowledge of you mine. There are of course Soviet faults but in total is some 80% of Germans.

>You are a petty nationalist (I would even say borderline racist) who tries to skew everything to make Poland look like the victim of history.

Call me as you want. I call my self as patriot. If Poland was victim of history? Well much more then Germany, more then Russia, more then Belgium etc. We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor, flat territory where all goes back and forth. This is the difference between Canada and Poland. Its geographical location. You should think about it.

>Poland is a nation that does not matter on the world stage. GET OVER IT,

No comments. Do you love anything, maybe you only love is dollar?

>don't keep trying to blame others/make excuses for Poland's failure. you can try to blame Germans/Germany for Poland's misfortune,

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed. You do not know what you talking about. It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations. In Germany still Nazi party exists.

>but her own leaders did not act to Poland's best interests in the situation, and that is why what happened happened.

What happened? The II WW? Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job? It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity.

>If Poland's own rulers hadn't of weakened her before the partitions, the partitions wouldn't of been successful, end of story.

Yes, democratic countries are weak. Poland was in some sense democratic country (less then USA of that days).
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world, just after USA. Beside role of “Solidarity” in last century it indicates something. Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history. There a lot of small countries which participation is important.

>asking someone """"are you a Nazi?"""" implies that you think they are. I don't know about in Poland, but when we meet a new person in the English world we don't automatically ask them """"are you a Nazi?""""

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant. It was only an example in conversation with you. It was not a personal question. You to often exaggerate.

> and finally I don't care how or why Poland is suffering!

That is bad. You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland. Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps. Just beautiful. I could not expect anything more. Now: Are you Nazi?

>I asked for a reference and got it, that is all that was needed. not some lecture from a crusading nationalist who likes to dabble in historical revision (but its more like historical denial)

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland. Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism. I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland ))), I do not look for revision. You do.

>The Potsdam agreement was not a binding agreement, and it never gave the land to Poland, it gave them temporary administration over the lands,

It is you interpretation check the American, British and other atlases. Give me the “temporary” proof if you can.

>and using that administration they expelled and murdered millions of Germans,

millions? Do not be funny. Murdered maybe accidentally a few, it could happened because the post war disorder. After the war, what was German fault anyway. Millions you are absolute arrogant, where came from the number. You will have to apologize I am sure. In total was 3 millions how many death. Such number you are perfect crazy in XIX century Trucks did kill 1.5 million Armenians and we know it and after WW II in center of Europe MILLIONS of Germans. I have no words on you insolence. You will apologize it in bold big font on first line of the discussion or I will publicize you all around the World.

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

If (1): As I have already clarified, the GA criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate GA status, or reassessed. CurtisNaito's track record of OWNership and edit-warring indicates that the former is impossible, leaving the latter option. Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick.
:If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks. (Note that I don't actually think this is why you blocked me. I'm grabbing at straws.)Sorry. Just noticed this.  (聖やや) 
If (3): You may be right, but look what I have had to deal with: CurtisNaito has requested four times in the last five months, on both ANI and ArbCom, that I be site-banned for disagreeing with his edits, even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too. If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.
If (4): Tell me the policy. I won't violate it again. I also won't appeal the block, though, since I've been here too long for ignorance of the rules to be a valid excuse.

4aa6fa7374b115ba,"This is total tripe!!  A bunch of brainwaahed, Glasweigian, nutters running down Goodison Rd does not prove a Catholic bias at EFC. Or, some loons in the Kop on a derby day.   Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. 

The split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.

Leeds University Study:-

Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.

The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.

The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.

The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.

Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.

However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.

Another feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I note that in the quote from Armstrong where she says """"You are not a stranger to riots yourself, I understand, are you? You have taken part in them yourself."""", the word riots has been linked to 1981 Brixton riot. As I indicated in my edit summary when I removed this link, I don't think it is appropriate to link to that page since we don't know whether Armstrong was referring to that incident. I note that a number of references have been added to support the view that Armstrong was referring to the 1981 Brixton riots yet I don't see that they do. Armstrong said nothing further in the interview to suggest she was referring to 1981 and looking at the references, they don't seem to say Armstrong was referring to 1981 either. 

I note that the article says that Howe """"was arrested and tried for riot, affray and assault"""" in 1970. Considering that, I think it is difficult for us to assume Armstrong was referring to 1981.

96e67a1b8cf0a182,"Elen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.

1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted """"facts"""" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.

I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level """"evidence"""", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!

The problem with the """"sports organization"""" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of """"fact"""" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.

(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)

And if I must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell """"CAT"""" if they are spotted the """"C"""" and the """"A"""".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (Throwing out Pillar #2)

Ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  I assert that hasn't happened in Cena-Rock, myself.  (One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)

And in stating """"These are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  He probably doesn't even understand what I'm saying to him, frankly!  And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?

At minimum, it's going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users, for starters.  I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!    ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Stop taking this personally. No-one actually knows you, all we have to go on are a set of edits. We are largely strangers to each other - strong statements like """"betrayal"""" and """"slander"""" suggest motives that imply the other editor has taken against you personally.
 You are treating people's comments in a strangely literal way. If you don't understand what someone says - just ask them to explain a different way. Do not assume that everything is an attack.
 Copyright - yes you may absolutely tag and report something that appears to have been copied and pasted from another source.  What you need to watch for is that the other site didn't get its material from Wikipedia to start with.  They don't always credit Wikipedia as the source. However, it is better to tag it than not - the project cannot afford the risk.
 Notability - rather than tag an article for deletion, start a discussion. With the soap opera characters, starting a general discussion about notability at the WikiProject is a good idea.  If the talkpage is active, start a discussion there. Always try to notify the article creator.
 Read WP:BEFORE.  Non-notable articles rarely damage the project unless they are also inaccurate or completely foolish (an article about my cat for example would be completely foolish, as the cat is known to no-one outside my family and our neighbours, and is just an ordinary cat), so there's often no urgent rush to delete things that are non-notable.  Someone spent time and effort working on it.  What other steps might be taken - can the information be merged into another article and a WP:REDIRECT used, for example.
 If you eventually decide that nominating for a deletion discussion is the only option, use a neutral rationale. Do not attack the article creator because they have disagreed with you. Remember it is a discussion. Do not attribute any motive to those who disagree other than the differing viewpoint of a stranger.
 Images - if you find someone has pirated an image from a newspaper website, and uploaded it as their own work, yes you absolutely must tag it as a copyvio for speedy deletion.  In other instances, it is better to identify the least drastic option to deal with the damage.  Can I fix it myself? Can I alert the uploader - maybe they just made a mistake? If in doubt, always tag for WP:PUF which results in a discussion, not for deletion.
 Talk - explain why you thought what you did. Don't post reams of justifications and question the motives of others. You may be right, but you'll lose if you can't discuss things with people.

7ced5c8661a918b8,"Pseudoscience Category ==

I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category, as it does fulfill any of WIkipedia's requirements of pseudoscience. Wikipedia states:

Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia:

Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.

To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.

""""AIDS denialists"""" are not proposing a new form of science based on non-scientific methods, they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make, and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science. In fact, """"AIDS denialists"""" claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly. In fact, all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can't verify.

Sorry for the delay in replying. I've only just seen your comments on the Norwegian schools. I was expecting a reply on my talk page! We've developed the criteria for assessing schools as we've gone along. It probably doesn't make that much difference if a school is top or high, but the idea is to have at least one top importance school from each country. So far we've found the alumni to be one of the most effective ways to judge a school's importance but the system is inevitably subjective. These three Norwegian schools are amongst the oldest in the world and there might well be a case for making them all top importance, especially if they were indeed the only schools in the country for many centuries. It's very difficult to compare the three, especially when the articles are so short. I think it might be best to wait until the articles have been expanded and then request a re-assessment.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.

858bc38eb98f2e06,"Born John Webb, John Silas Wilson A.K.A. “BIG HITZ” was born in Chicago Illinois along with eight siblings. Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S.

He's saying that the ODA advises site visitors that the [www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp Office of Postsecondary Education] of the United States Department of Education has questionable accuracy in its database of accredited U.S. colleges.  But, we are to blindly accept that an Archive.org snapshot of the Oregon ODA is infallible, even better and more perfect than a very similar database kept by the United States government.  We're to believe that it's important for Wikipedia to assert that WIU was """"operating illegally"""", even though this charge was never mentioned in any news source of any kind, even though this charge was never filed in any court in Pennsylvania or any court in any jurisdiction in the world.  And we're to take this on the word of someone who has been lambasting unaccredited institutions across the Internet for decades, who can't find a single like-minded editor other than an admin with whom he shares 90% of their joint editing activity on articles dealing with unaccredited institutions.

I count 12 of those 44 where the phrase is used to describe the phenomenon of an unaccredited educational organization.  I wonder if I searched the history of those 12 articles, would I find that either TallMagic or his partner admin Orlady have added that phrase """"operating illegally"""" to Wikipedia, and whether the source will be cited, and if so, will it be a mainstream media report that asserts the importance, or whether it will be an Archive.org snapshot of this purportedly infallible Oregon state website?

This brings us to the question of exclusive use of translations, which bring their own conscious and unconscious baggage which cause differences between the original and the translation.  I suggest that where possible, both the original and the translated versions be cited. For instance Mary Alice Waters' translation of """"Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War"""" ISBN 0873488245 is affected both by her marxist ideology, and her lack of familiarity with the Cuban milieu, especially that of the Sierra Maestra and ethnic roots.  To Waters the Sierra Montuno, inheritor to the Taíno, Cimarrón and Mambí cultures wild, armed and dangerous is a mere peasant.  In addition, one should take into consideration the authors’ own biases, Guevara was a tireless self-promoter, as were and still are many powerful figures in history, from Ramses II to Columbus, and Batista to Kissinger.

 Arbitrary revision reverting 

If you are going to reverse a revision that has been researched and well crafted, be consistent across the board.  Compare content with other similar entries which are considered acceptable, then rethink your actions.  Read the Muhammed Ali, Fedor Emelianenko, Chuck Liddell biographies for examples of what is considered relevant information, particularly regarding fight descriptions.  Make changes to all of those wiki entries if you feel that your standards should be universally accepted.

I have studied this subject in-depth and spoke with current students, one of which was initiated in the Knowledge just last year. This is what my research shows me:
The tecniques are very simple and there is ample evidence that these are quite ancient and referred to in many practices, books and poems
There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.
Four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown (these are made verbally and no legal document signed, students are trusted implicitly.) Give a fair chance to Knowledge, don't reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings. 
The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.
As there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy, students are free to use these techniques (one hour per day is recommended). There is no cohersion to do anything, beyond the very mild promise """"give a fair chance to the practice.""""

And no, Jim, my sources do not include ex-students. This is an article on Prem Rawat/Maharaji, not his critics. We have added a critics section because there are critics like you and it is needed for a good encyclopedic  NPOV article.

Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of """"God is ever a geometer"""", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article.

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk

Assault guns were easier, cheaper and less time consuming to produce than turreted tanks and that is why German factories built them in large numbers.

The adjustable spanner#Proper use section of this article still seems to be self-contradictory.

I found one discussion  that has some physics-based arguments that I found pretty persuasive.
One commenter says that the preferred way to use a pipe wrench is the opposite direction from the preferred way to use an adjustable wrench,
which may explain why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

Norm Abram, in """"Adjustable Wrench"""",
implies that (unlike a basin wrench) an adjustable wrench often works adequately even when turned the """"wrong way"""", such as when doing the """"flip trick"""".
This may also contribute to why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

What exactly is the advantage of turning it the """"right"""" way versus the """"wrong"""" way?
Too often I hear that turning it the """"wrong"""" way is """"more likely to round off the corners"""" without any more details,
but I prefer an explanation that would make it possible to work out from first principles which way is the """"right"""" way.

Byzantiums invented the symbol.
Byzantiums are the only ones to use the symbol.
Mehmet II and the Ottomans definately copied the flag.

So there is no need to drown the small section in repeated attempts to show that a turk at some point passed through a nation that had used the symbol at some point as a hopeless counter.

What is being claimed:

The flag of Byzantium, crescent moon and star was flying over Byzantium when as the Turks arrived to lay siege.
Byzantium was the first state to use the symbols as national state symbols.

The fact that symbol is old has nothing to do with the Byzantium theory. It is about how the Turks came to adopt the symbol, not who invented it.  It is already stated  above (please read this carefully, i will repeat) It is already stated that the symbol has ancient roots above the section on Byzantium.  What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism, but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS, the Turks borrowed the symbols. Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged, the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums.

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

OK people let's calm, this down, and stop trying to make political points over nationality. I've reverted to the original wording 'actor from Northern Ireland' rather than later editors who have insisted on putting in 'British' or 'Irish'. This termonlogy is both factually correct and politically neutral. As for the anonymous poster who changed the Northern Irish flag to the flag of the Republic of Ireland on the grounds that he 'personally knows him' can I suggest you look at a map please - County Armagh is not in the Republic (as Recognised by the Republic itself under the Good Friday agreement, incidentally). So, legally Morgan was born a British citizen. 'Peronally knowing him' does not result in an international border mysterious shifting several hundred miles 21 years ago!

As someone whose (Catholic) family is fromn Northern Ireland (but originally from the South, as it happens) I know there is very little common grounds on symbols, flags, or terminology. I'm well aware the Northern Irish flag isn't as neutral as it could be. But until and unless there are finally flags and terminolgy that's acceptable to both sides, we're stuck with what we've got. And in Wikipedia, people from the North have the Northern Irish flag in their little infobox. We may not like it (GOD I don't like that flag!) but it is legally the correct one.

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable.

The edit history system highlights deletions in red on a green or yellow background. Unless you carefully read all the edit history text line by line, you are quite likely not to notice a HTML comment code Invisible Comment block, which at first glance looks just like the normal text which is published in that version of the article. If you are not familiar with HTML source code, this is effectively a """"stealth"""" deletion,  although obviously not entirely an invisible one.

The Hubertus Bigend page was originally written in August 2007 i.e. months before your excellent Node Magazine page in October 2007

The fictional Wikipedia biography of the character Hubertus Bigend is now inextricably linked with any new discussions of that character in either Pattern Recognition or Spook Country.

The references to the use of Google and Wikipedia and other online resources by William Gibson, and by mainstream media book reviewers and fans, are precisely those currently categorised as  External References. This is  not a comprehensive list of reviews of the book, but only some of the ones which mention this """"online cloud"""" or which are part of that cloud itself. These references are now orphaned and out of context.

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )

Thank you for your thoughts, especially on your expressed belief in my in-good-faith actions. I've recently discovered (perhaps rediscovered) that the article was possibly semiprotected and that my bold (as per WP:BOLD and perhaps contrary to WP:CYCLE) act of trying to rename it might require some form of consensus on that step. I could take the liberty and not agree with you that I have given a proposal at all, exactly because of my act (without any prior discussion about it) given, and if so, I could conclude that then there was nothing to reject in the first place. Not to mention that the terms overwhelming or even majority are to the least inappropriate, if not even biased. I concur that the argument of temporal proximity of discussions and renamings could be regarded as an arguments for not to rename again, but I think it doesn't suffice. Thank you for the link provided, I cherish the gesture a lot.
I could again be free and express my disagreement with your opinion that I have to perform the rename via WP:RM, for I could consider that there is no obligatory procedure to be taken for such an act of renaming. Why, WP:RM is merely a guideline, if it is at all - nothing is stated at the page. Perhaps a project is the right name to select for WP:RM, as it is implied on the page itself. Since, the term project inherently has no attributes of obligation - if not even posesses a certain quality of casualness - I might considered the term has quite different characteristics.

Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner. You cannot deny the fact that the film clearly passes judgment on the character on this and other levels. I just wanted to summarize this in a few words. 
  

Most of the already-existing text (e.g. terms such as """"reckless"""" or """"egotistical"""") would also qualify as non-neutral if subjected to a thorough scrutiny.   

Thanks for the reply. I'd suggest finding references for any further changes you wish to make to the article. I also suggest raising any questions in article talk regrading other changes you propose.   
I'm not going to enter a futile edit war just for the heck of it, especially now that your attention seems to be fixed on my particular edit for this particular article, but I cannot leave this unanswered.

First of all, thank you  and  for being fair and reasonable in regards to my edits to the Filmography section for this page.  I'm glad this page is finally starting to look like the others of its type found on Wikipedia.  

In regards to """"unsourced and ridiculous awards"""", I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was """"nominated"""" for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them """"Nominated"""" as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

2b40d3da12a48d29,"==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom. 

(bloody hell, did we just agree on something, Uri? Will wonders never cease?)

 Yes, we did agree, and I'm glad at it. I hope it'll be a good beginning for tomorrow - I've got to log out now.

Dear MisfitToys,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Presumably, this is also why Langan was invited to be a Fellow of that organization. Whether or not those who rule over ISCID have a Creationist agenda is not the issue here; all that matters is that (1) they say they don't, which means that Langan is not embracing Creationism by being an ISCID Fellow; and (2) that the CTMU in fact accommodates evolution, as Langan has repeatedly stated.

f06e3dcb7e4cd509,"what context does """"enlargement of government power"""" belong here?
It does not belong. Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not. TFD seems to believe that believing in Progressive values is fringe, but he would be on Beck's side with side with that.
""""You have taken the quote out of context and the source is a high school textbook,""""
It is from Brittanica, and here is the full quote:
Origins of progressivism
Never were superficial signs more deceiving. Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.

Actually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.
This is very non-ambiguous
This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.
""""What is progressivism?
Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.
""""As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.""""
With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?

why is the article allowed to survive in this state? it apparently gets a POV pass by badly impersonating sardonic writing. most of the article is overt advocacy of a point of view (case making), beginning with an unsourced, ethereal claim that """"[t]here is no evidence [for cow tipping as described,] aside from (mostly unreliable) eyewitness reports"""". what is a """"(mostly unreliable) eyewitness"""" report? what about the part that is reliable? weasel words.

i don't think cows can be tipped either, but this is hardly an article that meets wikipedia policy/guidelines/standards for clarity, neutrality, or good writing. the second paragraph, for example, is badly written, pretend-intellectual humoro-babble for the sole purpose of setting up the inclusion of the cutesy, unnecessary phrase """"precarious ruminants"""". the refrigerator example is strained, nowhere mentioning center of gravity. rather, it encourages a lower center of gravity than an honest attempt to simulate a cow would have, while making sure to reduce the lever. that's just the start. i would hack/slash my way through the thing, but i can tell from the history that it's the pet of some watching worshipers.

37e9d340151a8d1f,"2010 team roster 

Moved from User talk:Kevin McE

Hi there. I wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited WP:CRYSTAL. I'm not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate. Thanks.   

I don't know what needs to be explained.  We cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year, because we do not know the future.  An encyclopaedia reports facts, not expectations.    

Hi again. Firstly, I moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow. I am still not clear exactly what at WP:CRYSTAL makes this content inappropriate. This is not a predicted team roster, it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim.   

It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year, that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that.  A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    

I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been """"guilty of having recorded an error"""" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   

I'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.  An """"entirely accurate description"""" of something that does not currently exist is not possible (and as a description, a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate).   

I find your position on this matter a little strange. You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time. I would note that, not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here, but also that a further ten names have been announced",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1db1a52a02fcc0f1,":I won't reiterate what the professor has stated above, but there is a """"Middle-Earth"""" franchise, or at the very least there is a """"Lord of the Rings"""" franchise"""" to which all Lord of the Rings adaptations belong. You cannot just go out and make a Lord of the Rings film without the required licensing, since all LOTR films are made from the same intellectual property. The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information. As for the information being out of date, there is usually a short lag between Sunday-Monday as the data is released and then update in the chart.

You are right about the referenced article is about not chaning the fundamental principles of democracy. And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman. He does not want the word """"democracy"""". He then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all (international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constition"""" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" and again was wrongfully pushing the word """"constitution"""" (which Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in.

9057c8c5f466dd5e,"Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).  For example, the first use of the word """"channeled"""" had quotes around it.  I was the one who put those quotes in, though someone else removed them.  I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.  I'm mentioning these small things simply as examples to show people that the neutrality of the article is important to me.  And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

Verbal, I would like to try to bury the hatchet and work together on this article.  Your interest in the article appears to me to be negative, but I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong and to see your point of view.  In order to work together, we'll have to discuss specifics of the article on this page.  We'll need to discuss individual passages as well as the broader issues of the article's size and the proportion of primary to secondary cites.  If we make a concerted effort to work together, I'm sure we can come to an understanding and improve the article.  Are you with me on this?  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

94a6999d309e2fa3,"::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. 
Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.
Part of the problem may be that """"nationalist"""" in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead """"patriotic"""" does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. 
Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish """"patria"""" (fatherland), """"patriota"""" and """"patriótico"""" are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves """"patriotas"""" in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of """"abertzale"""" but """"nationalists"""". On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). 
Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. 
Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. 
PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against """"excessive"""" decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. 
Whatever the case, the term """"unionist"""" seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is """"Spanish nationalist"""" as more precise term, """"unionist"""" is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV. 
I'd really like to hear from Mountolive. He's not said a single word.

""""During Pearl Jam's concert at the Orange Stage in 2000, a violent accident occurred. Nine people died in front of the stage. The exact conditions as to how they died have been examined by both the police and the public prosecutor and at subsequent civil trials - the conclusion of these determines that it was an accident. Many people fell down, which often happens at big concerts, but at one place they did not get up again. Some crowdsurfers fell into this """"hole"""" and are believed to have been factors of the event turning wrong (crowdsurfing was subsequently forbidden across most of Europe). The people at the bottom died of suffocation. When the security guards in front of the stage got to the area after the music had been stopped it was too late. In the following year, the accident led to massive changes with regards to safety to avoid similar situations - not just at Roskilde Festival, the security conditions for festivals everywhere in Europe changed. Before the accident in 2000, Roskilde Festival was considered one of the safest festivals, and yet the accident happened there. Many other festivals have smaller safety systems than Roskilde Festival and revised their procedures even further. For instance, Glastonbury Festival in England chose to cancel its festival in 2001 to have enough time to reorganize the safety planning since the festival in 2000 was not at all at level with Roskilde Festival. Each year Roskilde Festival makes an extensive health and safety assessment which the festival is executed on the basis of. The accident at the Orange Stage led to the construction of a memorial grove with a stone with the inscription """"How fragile we are"""" surrounded by nine trees.""""

Let me remind Zleitzen and the others here that the concepts of human rights and all of it's associated ideals of democracy, freedom, rule of law, etc. ARE indeed western-centric! Where do you think these terms originated? Iran? Even the supposedly objective Amnesty International originated in the West (England). In fact, if it weren't for the democracies and freedoms of the West, YOU nor I would have the forum (freedom?) to write here in these pages.  Indeed,  Wikipedia would NEVER have been created, and your pal George Orwell would have been jailed by the Nazis!  I'm am indeed curious: when were you born?

I had a laugh when I read this:

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO here,

I bring to you a guy who needs to be immediately sent off...Well, maybe we'll show a yellow card to the user, but his creation needs to receive marching orders as soon as possible!

Take a look at this invented player, Cristiano Sonko, in FC Porto (it does not appear in the team's article, but it did display in the SQUAD TEMPLATE until a while ago; i was able to find the template and revert it, still don't know how to remove the article). If you look closely, the made-up player's fullname, CRISTIANO SONKO DOS SANTOS AVERIO is a (vandalic!!) pun on Manchester United's CRISTIANO RONALDO DOS SANTOS AVEIRO (replacing RONALDO with SONKO and misspelling AVEIRO). I checked several sites and there is no SONKO playing either for PORTO or PAÇOS DE FERREIRA (youth or senior) as the storyline and infobox state, it's just NOT TRUE.

Also, for further proof this is idiotic vandalism, take a look at this article creator's talkpage (a fellow by the name ZANRAMON ELITE): (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zanramon_elite). Please have a look at it man, and remove it (or ask someone to do so, i do not know how to proceed).

Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour. Fix those two things and the other faults will fizzle away.~Talk to me! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The case involves the return of alleged texts belonging to Judaica in possession of the Russian government which could end up on the black market.

As a result of the lawsuit, the Russian Federation has cancelled loans to Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery in Washington, the J.

In June 2011, the Justice Department filed a notice it would not support the confiscation of Russian artwork on loan as retaliation. (See: """"AGUDAS CHASIDEI CHABAD OF UNITED STATES v.

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Hi, thanks for contributing to the Crème caramel article. I have a few comments which I hope will help you edit this and other articles more effectively.

You have changed 'flan' to 'Flan', arguing that 'flan' is a proper noun. Do you have any evidence for that?  Why is it not a common noun like other names of dishes, e.g. pizza, roast beef, moussaka, etc.?  Do you have any reliable sources backing up your claim?

You have also added vertical whitespace presumably to make the photos format better.  Unfortunately, that method is not reliable  as WP:PIC says, """"Remember that text will flow and wrap differently for other users, based on their chosen browser, screen resolution, default font size, accessibility options, number of toolbars and sidebars (such as instant messaging panes) and more.

Thanks Doc, one gots to like a detail guy (the refernce to """"guy"""" being intended as gender neutral). I should like to characterize it as trying to get an answer and redirecting the topic back to that topic (not without personal failures along the way) of getting an answer; rather than pestering. Though when someone doesn't want to answer the on-topic question, and only responds with condescending stonewalling, I have no doubt that the pony would characterize the May fly as pestering her.

The other points you make, and more you raise in your second post, run down a path that, in avoiding a failure to stay on topic, we shouldn’t take. As to Dayewalker's gender: if Dayewalker (or one of Dayewalker's friends or acquaintances) would simply state that Dayewalker wishes to be referred to by the male or female personal pronoun, that works for me. I don't care which Dayewalker actually is. Whichever they wish to have used here is fine. Until then, and basing my guess on the name alone, and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalker's words or actions, I have referred to Dayewalker as a she. If that is not the correct gender, just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun. If Carol O'Conner could live with his name and constant gender misidentification, one hopes that an adult with the name Dayewalker should realize people are going to offer up their best guess at what gender pronoun to use.
 
I did, having noted your apparent, yet vague, complaint, searched via Google. The first result for """"Dayewalker"""" is to someone named """"Chris"""" on Twitter. No help there, """"Chris"""" could be male, could be female. The next one of any potential was someone named """"Daye Walker,"""" so that's promising. Maybe Dayewalker is """"Daye Walker."""" Makes sense. I can't know for sure, but it appears that """"Daye Walker"""" is a woman as Daye Walker puts another name that would appear to be a maiden family name in parenthesis. However, in a modern age, that may not be what she is indicating by this choice of presenting her name, nor is that taking of one's spouse's family name upon marriage universal to either gender, But why guess when someone could simply state the fact? Unless one perfers to create issues and avoid answering the on-topic question posed.75.4.195.159

3163ef31abb083a8,"Elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well, but I only put it out there for discussion.  Argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable.  These diagrams are metaphors, far from exact ones, of the imaginary field, yet appear in the article. Imaginary numbers are not yet points.  Keith Devlin wrote """"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion."""" Yet he also stated """"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number."""" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that """"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors."""" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed. Gao, X, et. al,  Beijing, China 1998, Google eBook: 108] They're the clock hand that points to the hour, not the hour point. 

Consistent with this logic, it's better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself.  This sidesteps the variability of complex number position: its the plane's fault, if you will.  Want this grounded in mathematical foundations?  Look no further than the Riemann hypothesis.

Riemann extended Euler's zeta function, which Euler developed to find prime numbers, to define complex numbers.  Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.

The only singularity of z(s) is the simple pole at s, or 1. There is no reason to assume complex numbers are points.  I don't believe this is non-standard. It is profound and documented.

When thinking about merging articles, one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it's new and needs more content, or it will always be small. In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use?

Some of the examples of """"unresolved"""" technologies promoted as disruptive cannot honestly be considered """"unresolved"""".  The most glaring of these is """"e-commerce vs. physical shops"""".  It is absolutely clear that both e-commerce and physical shops are completely entrenched in their own respective niches, and while there is a lot of competition between them in some areas, the idea that either one could entirely supplant and eliminate the other in the forseeable future* is lunacy.  Similar arguments apply to """"free / open-source vs. proprietary software"""" and """"Internet Video on Demand and IPTV vs. Advertising supported broadcast and cable television"""".

The examples of """"Music downloads and File sharing vs. compact discs"""", """"ebooks vs. paper books"""", and """"VoIP (and VoIP over 802.11) vs. traditional telephone and mobile phone service"""" are much better examples of """"unresolved"""" potentially disruptive technologies.

c2d8f7e4e6e4d2b8,"Adding unreferenced entries of former employees to lists containing BLP material 

Hello, Please do not add unreferenced names as entries to the list of former employees in articles. Including this type of material in articles does not abide by current consensus and its inclusion is strongly discouraged in our policies and guidelines. The rationales are as follows:

WP:NOT tells us, Wikipedia is """"not an indiscriminate collection of information.""""  As that section describes, just because something is true, doesn't necessarily mean the info belongs in Wikipedia.  
As per WP:V, we cannot include information in Wikipedia that is not verifiable and sourced. 
 WP:Source list tells us that lists included within articles (including people's names) are subject to the same need for references as any other information in the article. 
Per WP:BLP, we have to be especially careful about including un-sourced info about living persons.

If you look at articles about companies in general, you will not find mention of previous employees, except in those cases where the employee was particularly notable.  Even then, the information is not presented just as a list of names, but is incorporated into the text itself (for example, when a company's article talks about the policies a previous CEO had, or when they mention the discovery/invention of a former engineer/researcher). If a preexisting article is already in the encyclopedia for the person you want to add to a list, it's generally regarded as sufficient to support their inclusion in list material in another article. cheers   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This paragraph needs editing.  It has several problems

 Moving to Germany had nothing to do with Adult films.
 This sentence is superflous:  """"Other films included Man to Men and Jawbreaker.""""
 This sentence seems to be selling the films or gratuitously promoting them. """"Scenes from some films have been re-released as part of compilations which is common in the porn industry. The compilation Touched by an Anal was released in 1997; a more recent release was in 2006, Mansex Meltdown.""""
 This sentence has nothing to do with the Adult Film Career heading: """"Though he has appeared in gay and bisexual porn films, Sanchez identifies as heterosexual and has stated that he has had no homosexual contact since joining the Corps in 2003.""""

Re-write for Adult Career 2.0

So, we could re-write:

In the early 1990's, Matt Sanchez lived in Montreal, Canada where he worked in the adult entertainment industry in all-male films for prominent directors John Rutherford and Kristen Bjorn and Chi Chi Larue at the studios Bijou, Catalina and Falcon Video.  For French-speaking films, he used the stage name Pierre LaBranche, but all of his titles in the United States were under Rod Majors.   

During his career, Sanchez stared in several award-winning adult films including Call of the Wild, Jawbreaker and Idol Country co-starring Ryan Idol and Marco Rossi. 

Scenes from many films have recently been re-released as part of compilations; Sanchez stated in an interview with Radar Magazine that it """"was just the nature of the business, you shoot a lot of films and they use them forever."""" Sanchez later wrote, """"In porn, everything taboo is trivialized and everything trivial is magnified.""""

 """"Scholars are trained to scrutinize, to insist on adequate evidence, to ferret out logical inconsistencies and weak arguments. We are naturally suspicious of claims that go beyond our experience. Scholars are trained skeptics. Our professional motto is 'show me'. Where's your evidence? If you can't prove it, you shouldn't believe it!...If trust is the natural disposition of childhood, doubt is our disposition as adults.

  Army Medical Services Museum branding equipment Dear Gaius, 

My name is Simon Barnard. I'm an author and illustrator residing in Melbourne, Australia. Currently I'm producing a book on British convicts transported to Australia with Text Publishing. 

Amongst the convicts sentenced to Australia are over 1,000 army deserters, many of whom were branded with a 'd'. Your photo of the branding equipment and human skin located in the Army Medical Museum is of great interest to me. 

I've contacted the Museum in an attempt obtain more information and, in particularly, a photo of the skin, but they're unable to assist.

I'm rather desperate to obtain a decent photo of the skin and am hoping you might be able to help me in this bizarre quest. 

Yours,
Simon Barnard

48fda0fca981e131,"Thanks for your comments to the scoring system. It was, if you can see, for the first 2 rounds, the first person who gets the correct answer received a times-infinity bonus because all others are given 0 points. My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.

Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer. So what I think after hearing your opinion is, to keep the multiplying system, but the multiplier may be reduced from *4, *2, *1.5 to something like *2, *1.5, *1.2 (something greater than 1 but not greater than 1.5).

Ottoman, why was the picture removed? It is found in the archives. 

Do not blame me! -) I could not figure that out (why someone do not like the wording """"local defense line"""" especially most of them in daily cloths) plus the logic of other things (considerations other than the history, I guess) that is happening on this page. If this would be my history, I would not be reckless on my heroes. Whaetever.  

I removed it because I thought that it came from the Battle of Van and not the Van Resistance.   

Ottoman, could you please type the entire passage from Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p. 38, that talks about the 1st Armenian Republic? This doesn't sound right, but I want to see where it's coming from. 
Nowhere on that page it talks about the first Armenian republic. It does indeed talk about the Armenians. It first talk about Max Scheubner, it also quote from him. Then talk about the ten commandments of the Ittihadists and the Turkish government plan of destruction of the entire Armenian community. Then, the only thing which is the closest to what Ottomanreference attribute to that page is this following passage: Through the use of centralized planning and modern communication systems, all Armenians were to be assaulted. For the Turks, the sole question was: When? They did not have long to wait. In spring of 1915, Russian troops invaded Turkish territory following a failed Turkish offensive in the Caucasus. Sensing the opportunity, nationalist Armenians established a provisional government in the Russian-occupied era. Here was the proof of the """"internal enemy"""" the Turks had long claimed them to be, and Enver Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, did not hesitate to... Then the rest of the page relate to the destruction of the Armenians. This is also another example of a footnote not supporting the text it is supposed to source.  (ix) 

The book is at the state library; I have a very short note. It says; """"page 38, the setting of the provisional government"""". It was in the introduction section of the book about Holocaust (Jews) and talking about WWI in general. Next time; when I am at library, I will get the text. But if there was more than this, I would have it in my notes.

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

Peace! Always! Forever!

Who is he to decide which regions get certain shades of red to indicate their """"southern-ness""""?  His maps are too vague and too subjective.  Stop replacing the maps, sir, or we will continue to reverse your edits, which you take at liberty without a backing of facts or consensus.  There should be, like there is now, only 3 ways a state should be shown on the map: Southern (red), Not Southern (beige), and Southern with debate (striped red).  It is inaccurate to shade maps because there is no way that a gradation can be accurate in describing the various degrees of southern-ness.  For instance, I can tell you that the region of Maryland in which I work is more """"Southern"""" than parts of Montgomery County (which is geographically to the south of me) - so, in no way, would the shaded map be accurate in this, and other cases.

The reference to the term """"Homöopathie"""" being first published in 1807 is on page 263 of the Dean article (page 9 of the pdf), although his referencing is a little convoluted - it cites an article called """"Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis"""", referring to ref. 52 which itself refers back to ref. 24 which has it published in Hufeland’s Journal, xxvi (1807), 5–43.

9399bc62e6759a11,"Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.

I apologize for your recent difficulties, your block was clearly undeserved. Our governance here at Wikipedia is imperfect and too often administrators abuse the power we grant them. While we can’t prevent it we can work around it - in this case by creating a new identity to bypass your block - what we call a """"sockpuppet"""" account. Officially it’s frowned upon but so long as it’s undetected a sockpuppet is just as functional as a regular account. In fact many current and former administrators are sockpuppet accounts. The instructions below provide an easy guide to creating your new account and avoiding detection.

Instructions
 Log out of your Wikipedia account, clear your cookies (google """"how to clear all cookies"""" for instructions) and close your browser
 Download a new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This will be your dedicated Wikipedia browser
 Follow these instructions to permanently disable javascript in your new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer
 And these to permanently disable java: All browsers
 Reset your IP address. With most  ISPs the procedure is as follows: unplug your modem, wait 10 minutes, plug it back in. Use this website (http://www.whatsmyip.org/) to check your IP address before and after to verify it's changed. If it has, great, if not you may have to wait a few hours or a few days before repeating this procedure successfully
 Now you're ready to register your new Wikipedia account

Tips
 Never log into your old account from the same network or with the same browser as your new account
 Don't choose an account name similar to your old account name; administrators will use that as an excuse to sanction you
 Don't edit your user page or your talk page straight away; it's a dead giveaway you’re not a new user. Remember, this user is “new” to Wikipedia
 Mess up a little - forget to sign or sign incorrectly, split someone's comment “accidentally” - everything to give the impression this is your first experience editing Wikipedia
 Avoid noticeboards and contentious articles until you’ve made a reasonable number of edits; sockpuppet or not experienced Wikipedians don't appreciate being held to community standards by new users

All done. Happy editing and welcome back. I hope your new experience will be more pleasant.    — John Whales, Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web

A certain user has deleted correct information and posted politically biased information in this article.

Paragraph 1.
The original town name of Middletown was spelled """"Mattabeseck"""", this can be seen in the records of the general Assembly of Connecticut, which were QUOTED in this article until the ignorant and unscrupulous poster deleted the reference. This is significant in that southwestern Algonquin was spoken with a much harder inflection on the consonants, -and Mattabeseck is a southwestern Algonquin town.

Paragraph 2.
Quotations about Puritan life in general are irrelevant in this article. 

Paragraph 3.
William Cronin is not a reliable source for local detail in Connecticut. Cronin's highly inflammatory accounts of the history of the settlement of America is very controversial, and has been shown to be very factually inaccurate and unreliable. It was very popular as a piece of political argument, and very poor historical scholarship.

""""Vajpayee remains PM till new pm is asked to form a government""""   is this accurate?  All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president. This is not possible.- e 

He did in fact resign, and the president did accept it. However, as is custom, the president asked him to """"continue in office til alternative arrangements are made"""". (The Hindu) http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200405140111.htm

Was Manmohan Singh sworn-in on the 19th, or did he merely become the 'designate'? I have not seen anything saying he IS now PM.  18:46, May 20, 2004 (UTC)

 How about this? The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM. Is it a technical point that he is PM only after he's been sworn in?  | Talk 

 To summarise the entire process, once the election results in India are declared, the President has the prerogative to invite any person (by convention - the elected leader of the single largest party/coalition. Note again - the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament, as yet.) to form the government. Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment. If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot, the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President, who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made. Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered. In case of disputed numbers, the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion, within a stipulated period. And if the leader is unelected, he/she is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months.

 The case of the Parliament is a little more curious. The parliament is born on the day of its first session, when the individual members are sworn in. So technically, as on date, India has a government without a parliament. It would continue to remain so, until June 2, when the monsoon session convenes.  13:37, May 27, 2004 (UTC)

 Thanks, , for the clarification.  | Talk 

First non-Hindu?
The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first non-Hindu to be PM. I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this, but I think it's wrong (or at least disputable) in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee. At any rate, his father Feroze Gandhi was half-Muslim and half-Parsee, and if I'm not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay (not that anybody in the family is exactly religious!).  00:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning.
The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days.  Place names were informal, and often duplicated.  There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as """"Ballast Point"""" then.  This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.

Definition of Islamophobia
 Literal Definition of Phobia
pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.
 
   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.
 
   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.
 
   In a time of everyone just being out there for themselves competition; HardHead Records remains committed to sponsoring and promoting local up in coming artists that are committed to something more than that. Artists of the DMV(Dc, Maryland & Virginia) that share a desire for unity amongst other artists. Rich has a vision of his trademark being something above and beyond the rest!
 
   Rich is currently working to create a movement in the DMV, a dynasty of sorts… evolving from the very best of the best. HardHead Records takes pride in preserving Rich's initial vision, which resonates his own virtues and beliefs. Rich strongly believes that in working together, in being unified and remaining true to himself and all those that choose to join the movement that unity will prevail. This prevalence of unity will in fact produce victory for all those that have wisely chosen to be involved.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Interestingly enough, I have added such a section and have since added the stats in a more neutral edit in the kinect section of the article
My edit as follows
Xbox One gets to know you. It learns what you like and what you don’t. And brings it all together on your own personal home screen. And because every Xbox One comes with Kinect, it responds naturally to your voice, movements, and gestures.  The Xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience.  The kinect sensor detects when you are smiling, crying, angry, or bored. Every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood. Even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark. 
I've worked on several versions of this, and our self titled """"Edit Dictator"""" has been telling me it is not neutral or that I am implying something. Then he changes his argument to saying that I am duplicating information; How is information duplicated when what I add is not there in the first place?
You my friend are well advised to spread the word about the bias and censorship here that is especially prevalent in the Xbox one article 
Spread the word; Bias is used to remove pertinent information, Dissent/Criticism is silenced, And you are told that you are the one not being neutral when adding to the article.
Last time I checked, almost every major article on Wikipedia has not just links to it's subtopics but either short clips or brief summaries from the subtopic article pages added into the main article.
Apparently here in Xbox One it is different.
Double standards continue to be enforced and trust me, this information is neutral. These are facts.

My personal experience is that I've been called a 'self-hating Jew' by Ashkenaz when I affirm my identity as a Jewish Arab.  It happened when I studied Arabic, it happens in Shul when I say that non-European Jews in Israel face racism and it happens when I let people know I have Muslim friends.
I find that the term isn't just used to silence dissent in the Jewish community it's also used to erase our histories and experiences.

aeba791e4d78ac12,":I'm not sure what all the issues have been with your edits and the rest of the community. As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

""""In other words, views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all.

In particular, to elaborate on the last comment above, if you are able to prove something that nobody currently believes, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a proof. Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced.""""

This is why I believe that the section on racism should not be a section. A mere couple of sentences is, in my opinion, too much, but I would be willing to compromise with that. Because the presence of race as a section on Steiner's page gives the article undue weight.

Hello - I noticed your edits to EMF-related articles, which were brought up on the adminstrators' noticeboard.

I'd suggest discussing your concerns further on the article talk pages and trying to reach some sort of consensus about how to better present the mainstream view of EMF-related health issues. Tirades, however justified they may feel, are counterproductive in the long run. Although it often doesn't feel like it, reasonableness will eventually win out here if you're able to cool off and explain your position calmly. Making rapid-fire edits to the pages in question while a controversy is unsettled on the talk page is not a good idea.

Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.

""""Democrat Party"""" is a term used in the United States instead of """"Democratic Party"""" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer """"they are the only true adherents of democracy.""""[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term """"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.""""[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only """"deeply committed"""" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is """"trivial"""".[2][3] [4]

History of usage
The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, """"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.""""[5]

William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled """"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.'

The one-r spelling is not an """"implausible"""" typo; firstly, the article was created at that spelling in 2007, while the double-r spelling didn't exist until you created it a week ago. Secondly, 1976–77 Calgary Cowboys season and List of Blazers/Cowboys players both link to the single-r spelling; by having it deleted, you broke an existing link. Thirdly, several other references — this one, for example, and this one — do spell it with one r. And fourthly, just on principle alone """"Morin"""" is far more plausible than """"Morrin"""" just because it's a far more common surname to begin with.

With conflicting sources, it's certainly best that we don't get into a move war over it pending some kind of confirmation. But the one-r spelling, at the very least, isn't """"implausible"""" enough to warrant deletion in the meantime.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.

So I would like to contest his views being added here, or anywhere else for that matter. 
 Hallaq has been given a new section all by himself without any rationale. He is a western scholar so he should be included with other western scholars and given due weight. To be frank his weight should be LESS than other western scholars, as he is not a scholar of hadith per se. He is a scholar of law/jurisprudence, and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith. But he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith.  
 I would like to contest the creation of """"authenticity"""" subsection. My  argument is that this section is highly misleading. It leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason, whereas in reality almost all scholars(both western and eastern) criticize hadith because they consider it as """"inauthentic"""".

2bd1079531f58bc1,"Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""

Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?

I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.

If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.

Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).  

But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.

The section previously stated that on January 8, 2006, at the Consumer Electronics Show, it had been said that hd dvd was ahead of bluray. however they didn't cite it. I looked and the article I cited said they were neck and neck. 
    
OK, my reasoning on the cnn article was probably weak, but it still may be true. 
Bluray's website claims to have passed hd dvd, but I doubt that that is a very reliable place to look for info. Can someone find something else or revert it back? (I don't know how to do that)

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

The three-revert rule[edit]
Shortcut:
WP:3RR
Editors who engage in edit warring are liable to be BLOCKED from editing to prevent further disruption. While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.
The three-revert rule states:
An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.
A """"page"""" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A """"revert"""" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.
The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.
If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.""""

Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation.

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.
For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal). 
I am not saying that Perks is the ideal source of information, but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition, and one that is couched in more modern language.  (talk|contribs) 16:44, 1 November",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A lot of the Sikh history is being twisted by these people at their site. They will go to any lengths to promote their views.

Unfortunately, I do not at present have the time to deal with these people but I think that their approach of promoting their views under the Sikhism banner is deplorable and needs to be restrained.

4ec0ffdb4409fe48,"wikipedia entry on ten-string guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on """"ten-string guitar"""" from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the """"information"""" presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10-string guitar (both being 'littered with inaccuracies' and even deliberate misinformation). 

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to """"the ten-string guitar"""" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.

Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms """"10-string guitar"""" or """"ten-string guitar"""". Some of our American """"colleagues"""" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest """"scholarship"""".

As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the """"ten-string guitar"""" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical """"expertise"""" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an """"authority"""" who is in a position to """"educate"""" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for """"making kids dumb"""" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online """"encyclopaedia"""" for research.

I wonder what exactly you do here on WP? It is obvious that you want to be an administrator but you have failed to show the deportment and maturity of mind to make the grade. Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.  I am amazed that you have not been banned but I suppose your facility at quoting the rules, all while completely violating the spirit of WP preserves you.

Many of them subtly expressed their desire to see me dead, even though no one actually threatened me. I saw it wise to move to another country and keep my whereabouts guarded. I think I can do without Muslim cooperation and have little need for their friendship. They will stab their best friends in the back. I do not trust their smiles and offers of friendship. That is called Taqiyyah (the art of deception or what they term as “diplomacy”). That is their way to lull you into a false sense of security. Sorry BYT, nothing personal my friend.

I played that game of deception too without even thinking about it or being conscious of it. I too got involved into censoring facts about Islam just as Anonymous Editor so zealotry doing here.

And sorry, but as I'm actually and active member in TV, Film, and Anime and MoS I don't need to """"do research"""" because I already know, however, let's actually look Category:Lists of television characters and Category:Lists of anime and manga characters and which one do you see as the naming convention used for the bulk of all lists? Let me make it easy: Television main cat has 167 lists, of which 48 use your preferred schema (and most of those are serious AfD bait), 19 follow neither convention with 13 being the Characters in/of variety of non-lists. Anime/Manga, 269 lists, only 13 of which do not use List of X characters, and of those only 4 use your preferred version, 1 uses Characters of, and the rest need renaming/merging/deleting.  Then there is the less populated Category:Lists of film characters with only 57 lists. Of those, again, 27 do not use List of X characters or are not actual lists. Of those 27, 3 use the Characters of/in, 1 uses X characters, and 23 use your preferred List of characters in/of X. So, vast majority of all of those use List of X characters, and most of those that don't aren't lists that their respective projects would even approve of their existance, and if kept as is, would be renamed. So, where is your research to actually show that yours is preferred, except by a single project which also rejects other guidelines. Where is the overall naming guideline that truly supports your claim without special interpretation? And where is your discussions giving consensus to begin renaming any such lists you feel doesn't meet this personal interpretation without any discussion.   (talk · contribs)

fa9db351030f6c49,"Caucasoid

Is it really necessary to mention that some Uyghurs are fair-skinned and have Caucasoid traits? It sounds a bit like Nazi """"science"""" to me... Luis Rib

Well, they do have such traits. You can phrase it a bit differently if you like.  ]] 02:24, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)

It wouldn't be necessary if we lived in a world in which race (whether considered a real or constructed category) was irrelevant. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The ethnic characteristics of Uyghurs play an important role in discussions of the relationship between Uyghurs and Han Chinese and thus how """"Chinese"""" Xinjiang is or should be. In order to understand the politics of Uyghur/Chinese relations, it's important to know that these characteristics are commonly discussed.  20:20, 2 February 2006 
(UTC)

Why Caucasoid traits? These traits are probably more Semitic than Caucasoid. 86.166.123.12  

The more we try to parse this issue the thornier it gets. Read the Caucasian race entry in Wikipedia and see if you can find any way to separate Semitic from Caucasoid. The entire concept of race is in dispute, and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences, an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries. It might be better to describe, for example, a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold, as well as being largely Muslim, than to try to categorize them by """"race,"""" and so I'd agree that dropping """"Caucasoid"""" would be smart. After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their """"Caucasoid traits."""" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry. You can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual.

a4946a71139aaa42,"Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.
So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors.

Hello Zhang17, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to Jesus is Lord Church has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you.  -  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No original research?  Are you kidding me?  Years of research was reported (both failures and successes), that was also physically verified experimentally by over 20 others world-wide, and is cited on my original, and now archived (and now unalterable by me) open.org/davidc website, on both archive.go-here.com and archive.org in Europe.

The past updates on that archive collection details those years of experimental research, including the works of others on the subject around the world, beginning with the first physical verifications by James Hurl of Australia, and follows the story through to the last update before I gave up for a while out of exasperation, due to unrelenting stupidity and prejudice (don't confuse our religiously scientific dogma by citing facts).

The theory of operation I believe is clearly stated, and the """"flat earth"""" prejudice against the subject is apparent in the overall tone and presentation of the balance of the definition of """"Inertial_Propulsion"""".  A lone dissenting voice challenging the current dogma is how ALL of science progresses past the ignorance of yesteryears.

To disallow original research is to attempt to hold ALL of science to a stable state, and ignores the dynamic nature of the search for greater truths than we currently understand.

Science is NOT a BIBLE, and DOGMA is anathema to the entire process of research!

Well I checked you out, and you should be happy to know, I really don't take account age into consideration.  I'd be willing to take you on as a coachee, but there are 2 criteria.  1. You go up for RfA when I tell you your ready. 2. You disclose to me on or off wiki any other accounts you've had (I don't think you have, but I just feel the need for that rule.)  If you agree, your first lesson is to update the Admin coaching status page to reflect this.  Your second is to create a usersubpage User:Steve Crossin/AC and watchlist it.  I'll give you lessons there an what not.  Assuming everything works well, I'd say a late May, early June RfA would not be out of the question. ' talk

24 character article
Ok, so I did a quick format of the article, and started searching online for interviews with the actress. I have come up dry thus far, and was wondering if you have found anything.   

Specifically what article were you referring to? And, an admin has said I can use material from the 24 magazine.    

I was looking for those interviews, but I couldn't find them. I was trying to help with the Karen Hayes article.   

Ahh, the article on Miss Hayes P Hehe, I have a fair bit of info on her, and I can also now abuse the use of {{cite episode}}. A citation is a citation. Also, I know it hardly ever happens with TV shows, but what rating do you think the Nadia Yassir article would receive? That is, after the injunction is lifted.   

Definitely B, lots of references but needs to be more expansive for GA status and beyond. Once you gear up to do that, you could always post the references for Hayes that you find on her talk page, that way I could help out )   

Hehe, I could do that..and I think I will also work on trying to get Nadia Yassir to GA status. But my real goal? Getting Jack Bauer to featured article status. It would look quite good on an RFA. I'm gettng admin coaching. And also, I prefer bullets, so don't mind if I realign your comments on my talk page P

I just wanted to thank you very much for you input in the ANI discussion about vocal ranges. It is a very frustrating issue because it affects literally thousands of articles. You are the first person in the dicussion to understand and address some of the big concerns I have about what Tribal44 is doing. The problem is so widespread now (because it involves so many articles) that I don't even know where to begin to try to get the mess cleaned up. I'm sure her initial intentions were good when she thought it would be a good idea to put singers' vocal ranges into their articles, but when editors started reverting over and over again, and she kept reverting back, she obviously realized there was a problem. I can't get her to understand that even though a particular fact can be sourced, doesn't mean it's worthy of being included in a Wikipedia article. (However, many/most of her sourcing fails the reliability test.) Since this involves a huge number of articles, and not just a couple articles, how do you get Tribal to stop doing this in articles?

While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

Modern """"Kulitan"""" or """"Súlat Kapampangan"""" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it """"sus letras"""" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site """"Ang Baybayin"""", Santamaría's """"El """"Baybayin"""" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"""", Villamor's """"The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"""", and Marcilla y Martín's """"Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"""".

Gidday Richard, I note that you've swapped some text about between Aztec society and Daily life in the Aztec Empire articles. I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.

Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere.

The article would clearly benefit by having it pointed out that, although it could be, the experiment has as yet not been performed. In its original form the idea is to have a tunnel dug through the Earth so that a test object (""""cannonball"""") can be dropped into it. This is, of course, impossible. But the same physical principles would be revealed by using laboratory-sized massive bodies instead. The experiment could be performed in an Earth-based laboratory or in an orbiting satellite.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here is a quote for you: 

[quote]Sociologist and anthropologist Robert Stuckert examined census and fertility data to estimate how many blacks in America had passed as white, and how many whites had African ancestry as a result. His statistical tables showed that during the 1940s, 15,550 light-skinned blacks per year crossed over to live as whites, for a total of about 155,500 for the decade. Based on these figures, he determined that by 1950, some 21% of whites (about 28 million people then) had black ancestry within the last four generations, and he predicted that this number would only grow in the decades to come.[/quote]

ddd9eccdc06c7be6,"What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In response to a claim that liberalism does not advocate equality.

The foundational documents of liberalism stress both freedom and equality.  """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal...""""

We know those high ideals were expressed by a man who owned slaves, and that while we are much closer to true equality today, we still have a way to go.  Still, one of the two principles that unite liberals is the idea of equality, in the sense of equal rights.  The liberal movement has consistently been in that direction, with equality for Negros first, then for women, maybe someday for homosexuals.  

By equality, I mean equality before the law  obviously all men are not equal at birth, but the law should not favor those born with greater advantages.  Sometimes equality and freedom conflict.  My freedom to own slaves conflicts with the slave's equality under the law.  But more often the two ideals are complementary.  My equal rights give me the freedom to walk down the sidewalk without the law telling me I must step into the gutter to allow a better man to pass.

, thank you for the lesson about how people can say and act differently. The gap between your alleged """"mentoring"""" and the insulting comment like """"mother"""" is striking enough.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

3a3f5cb25031acdf,":@ you have not answered my question """"what did Franklin mean by """"Patriot"""" in 1773?"""" did he mean a supporter of the Good Old Cause, or did he mean something else? Instead you write """"I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations."""" Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)?
@ your argument """"The British colonists had made North America their country"""" is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word """"Confederate"""" for """"rebel"""" so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence """"The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests"""". In what way were the mobs patriotic? Even the phrase """"rebellious mobs"""" would not be accurate. """"anti-tax mobs"""" would be more accurate, but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs.

This paragraph in the introduction consists of two completely unrelated subjects. The 250th anniversary is already mentioned later in the article, so this sentence can probably be removed. The historic district sentence, then, could be incorporated somewhere else in the article. In fact, it is mentioned in the """"20th century to present"""" section so maybe we can move it there. I will make these changes tomorrow if no one objects.

Also, as I mentioned in my edit comment, I think the word """"semiquincentennial"""" should be removed. If a word is so obscure that you have to clarify what it means, why not just use the clarification instead? It looks a like a case of using a big word for the sake of using a big word.

-Stephen went to Christ Church Grammer School until 1962 when his family moved to Melbourne. There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers). The books have been named after his late Great Grand Father, Sir Edgar Bertram McKennal who was well known bronze sculpter in the earty 1900's in Melbourne who went on to becoming quite famous in Europe.

Only because Mr 4meter4 had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far I did not have a single chance to develop it. His article called ¨falsetto¨ is not about falsetto. It may be about his arrogance, who knows. There are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto. There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects. In England, Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan. Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto. What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me. Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it. Why? It would not fit to his article. He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World. The whole physiology of his ¨only¨ falsetto is based on encyclopedia? Well, perhaps it is enough for Wikipedia or himself. But not for me. No. There is much more out there only regarding physiology.

I do not know why BogHog changed to vcite or to vcite2 after he took over maintaining the Diberri tool.  Nor do I know what that means in every case.  The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory.  That may or may not mean BogHog explained it all to me once  ... and I may or may not have understood at the time.  When I use Boghog's new Diberri tool, I edit the output to use the old standard form, for consistency in citation style.  And I continue to use the vcite format in the autism suite.  That we now have a mix on FAs is because new editors may not always respect CITEVAR, and I may not catch them all.

Since August 2010, the underground and aboveground Cheongnyangni stations have been directly transferrable through a transfer passageway, contradicting Peterhansen2032's argument. As a rule of thumb, on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway, the information is combined into one, even for stations with different names (e.g. Isu Station, Cheonan Station). Rather than having to go through a disambiguation page to access information on one of the stations, it would be much more efficient to integrate it into one page for convenient viewing.

The first part seemed to be putting me in my place  when you could have written a note on my talk page.  Now that you've explained your position, I understand.  If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying """"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S."""" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.  Anyway, I understand your viewpoint on the actress photos, so thank you for taking the time to convey your thoughts.  Regards.    ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Request for Comments on Current events
Hello Fsotrain09 –

I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the current events page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:

One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the current events page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see the current events talk page. 
Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as British and Irish current events and Canadian current events) into fewer continental articles. For more, see the current events WikiProject talk page. 
Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. joturner

Guantanamo detainee
Thanks for the suggestion.

I have been wondering how to organize the data.

The DoD, and the Washington Post lists tried to shoehorn the names into the English style first name and last name format. It didn't work very well, because names can have so many different transliterations. And some nations, like Yemen, have areas where people can have a tribal name, that looks like a surname to us. Maybe sorting them by first name, within nationalities, would be better.

I'll work on it.  Geo Swan

AfDs
Hey there! I seem to be right behind you on new page patrol tonight, and have come across a couple of AfDs you have started on a couple of pages. You might want to consider tagging articles like Julie ju with a speedy deletion tag to save the trouble of taking them to AfD when they're quite obviously nonsense or non-notable. (I've also noticed several articles where you haven't finished the AfD process - don't know if you're going to get to that or not, but thought I'd remind you.) Cheers! Tony Fox

Bribe the Ghost
Hey  Just a friendly reminder to be sure to use an edit summary that says """"prod"""" when you propose an article for deletion. It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention. I left the prod tag there, though, just in case anyone denies the speedy deletion (which I doubt will happen). Anyway, thanks, just letting you know! Mangojuicetalk

Pije ocet
Yes, you are correct. I googled for a bit after I saw your change and it looks like it is Polish. I found a free online Polish translator (kinda like Babelfish) http://www.poltran.com/ and put in the text just to see what it was about ... the translation wasn't very helpful ... something about vinegar ... I'm going out on a limb and assuming that it is about some kind of wine.

But even so, the fact that the """"article"""" ends in """"aahahahahahaha"""" makes me very skeptical that there is any meaningful content ... that's pretty universal. BigDT

c9f47b0e452d41cc,"EESWARA CHEKAVA EZHAVAR  ( Summons everybody regarding tackling with Nair Vandals and also about SURNAMES of """"Ezhavar"""" ) 

Dear """"Ezhava"""" friends, I am a 6th Dan Black Belt in Shoto-Khan ( Karate ) and also having 2 Degrees in both Kalarippayattu (Vadakkan Style) and Shawolin Kung-fu ( Wing Chun Style ).. hailing from an Orthodox Chekava Ezhavar family in north Malabar, and also a Master in Law (M.L.M) and have been practicing in High Court . Our family is one of the reputed Chekava families in Kerala and trainers of """"Kalarippayattu"""" for centuries. And according to our family sayings our family was the leading """"Kalari""""(the temple for training """"Kalarippayattu"""")  in kerala for training """"Vadakkan Style"""" & """"Thekkan Style"""". And hear that when Nairs and all came to Kerala, they were very poor and good in character and were the servants of """"Namboothiri-Brahmin-Caste"""" .One thing we are very proud with to tell that, even centuries before the arrival of """"Brahmins"""" & """"Nairs"""" to kerala, here our ancestors had made this martial art of """"Kalarippayattu"""" well disciplined one and practiced with all of its systematized weaponry methods. At that time, we used the word """"Kalari"""" to mean the """"training place"""" from which word the name """"Kalarippayattu"""" was derived. After nairs had come here, """"Nairs"""" also started to study """"Kalarippayattu"""" from our kalari traditions under strict disciplines. Like the same...""""Muslims"""" and """"Chritians"""" also started mastering in """"the kalarippayattu"""" from """"Chekava Ezhavar"""" families.You can see so many """"Christian & Muslim"""" kalari experts also in the history. It doesn't mean that the """"kalarippayattu"""" was brought from Arabia. The """"Nairs"""" also came here some centuries back. But it had been a cultural martial orthodox tradition that was related to the blood of Malabar region as a part of its hereditary Chekava Society. But the shameless """"Nair Society"""" after coming here and after studying the tricks and techniques from the people inhibited here ..now would like to teach the world that they are the main practitioners of this martial art even when this martial art has been practiced here for thousands of years by the other people in this region. If so """"Muslims&Christians;"""" also can start claiming that it was brought here from Arabia.    But when the """"Brahmins (Namboothiris) started getting donations ( """" Dhanam"""") like lands, golds, and so many things in other kind..from the rulers from our castes in ancient times  , """"Brahmins"""" became landlords. """"Nairs"""" also became """"Rich"""" gradually when the nairs started a cheap system called """"Sambandham""""(a system of giving Nair Women to any rich traveller people in their way like """"Namboothiri"""" for using that woman for a short period of time comparing to marriage,  to obtain and to posses the lands,houses and their other assets held by those traveler / Namboodhiris. I saw in the wikipedia website that, this system was stopped by social reformers playing humiliating public Dramas in front of them with the help also of Gentle Nair Men.Because it was a system like which we cant see ever in the history or ever in the world even in the people inhabiting in jungles ).In the modern world, it is not called as """"sambandham"""" but we use some other words to denote these types of cultures. The same shameless system what they used to obtain """"Brahmin's"""" assets, now they use to obtain the reputation regarding """"Kalarippayattu"""". What the ancestors of the """"Nairs"""" did 
was not a problem of """"Ezhavar"""". It was just the problem of their ancestors. We don't want to feel guilty conscious in their cultural tragedy. We don't want to discuss about their past, but what makes us this much angry is their intolerance in others traditional supremacy and brutal nature to destroy our public records because of jealousy. Should we attack """"Nair"""" websites in return of it?..""""NO"""". We don't want to attack others. But what we want to do is we want to grow ourselves and we want to let others also to grow. This is our tradition. We don't want to attack others and we don't want to posses other's assets/cultures. And in one another point of view we can be proud also. Because even though these castes trying to include us under their  Varna System we should know that we are just above of all of these systems and , when the """"Brahmins"""" came to this place, our ancestors could  give them enough Land and Accommodations and Houses considering they are """"Brahmins"""". That is why the """"Brahmins"""" use the word """"ILLAM"""" for their houses.Because, actually the word """"ILLAM"""" meant for the houses of """"Ezhavar"""". Still the historical word """"ILLAM"""" is used for """"Ezhava Houses"""". As the """" Nairs"""" were the workers of """"Namboothiris"""" they also received some shares from the donations through """"Namboothiris"""" and also by """"Sambandham"""".

d9a6f425be8e0041,"Adding material, citations, general cleanup and resolving dispute 
I have painstakingly documented Warren Farrell's biography and professional discourse, supporting my edits with citations. In the Myth of Male Power, he endorses the concept of a ‘gender transition movement‘ as an alternative to either a ‘women's movement‘ or ‘men's movement‘. He has maintained this position since the book's publication in 1993, and has continued to promote the notion in every book published since. Additionally, I cannot find a single original, citable source to support use of the term masculinist being applied to him. As such, I have removed references to this non-neutral term.

I hope anyone watching this page will agree that I have enhanced the quality of this article tremendously. I am going to remove the request for cleanup and the neutrality dispute since I don't see any recent, active discussions that will remain unaddressed with the addition of the careful citations I have added.

(previous content:)
Warren Farrell (born 1943) is an American masculist author.

Farrell holds an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Political Science (UCLA; New York University (NYU)). He has taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and at Georgetown University, Rutgers, Brooklyn College, and American University.

With the publication of The Myth of Male Power, Farrell became one of the first masculists. The term is difficult to precisely define, but in his case masculism is a form of celebrating men as no less than women, and rejecting any sexism displayed against men by women. Since the early 1970s, he has been a champion of feminism, serving on the board of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Within a few years, he was asked to leave NOW as his views diverged from those generally held in the organization; most specifically, he was critical of what he saw as female exclusiveness and disregard for men's issues. His early books The Liberated Man and Why Men Are the Way They Are were more in the vein of a type of men's liberation–an approach to men's issues similar to that of feminism to women's issues. These texts were not critical of feminism.

Farrell's critics declare him to be sexist and have an anti-woman attitude (or misogynistic). However, despite his being broadly attacked by many latter-day feminists including Susan Faludi.  In answering his critics, Farrell argues that his approach is essentially of equality and humanism. 

His approach to gender issues has come to be the cornerstone of masculism. His ideology calls for gender equivalence and, unlike some other masculists, a reduction in traditional gender roles. He has made a critical examination of the power imbalance between the sexes, claiming that in some cases it favors women: """"The women's movement had done a wonderful job of freeing women from sex roles, but no one did the same for men"""". 

Farrell was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. He came ninety-seventh out of 135 candidates. 

On May 27, 2005 Farrell appeared on John Stossel's """"Give Me A Break"""" segment of 20/20 to discuss, in his view, why men earn more. In the report he is seen speaking before the Cato Institute. He asked members of the audience to stand if they worked at least two years at a job meeting certain criteria: jobs which exposed them to wind and rain or long hours, for example. It was almost entirely men who stood.

Some suggest that the Cato Institute event had been staged to promote Farrell's books and opinions. Nonetheless, the event served to illustrate one of Farrell's key points - that women tend to choose, and are generally encouraged by the popular press to choose, jobs that are socially fulfilling rather than monetarily fulfilling. For instance, men are encouraged to work well-paid, long-hours jobs, whereas women are encouraged to search for jobs that allow them more time with their children or are seen as socially pleasant, involving little physical labour or serious physical unpleasantness. These jobs, across the board, tend to be paid less than the former. In addition, men are more likely to do overtime (and are of course encouraged to do so) than women, so necessarily get paid for more hours worked.

A desire to place the United States last on the list, by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the """"fair"""" use of alphabetization to make the US hard to find.
Simply an oversight.  

Well, nobody replied so I renamed the section on Territories and regions to U.N. subregions. It's amazing that this list puts the United States last, even though it has most of the people and 1/3 of the area. Is someone trying to """"de-emphasize"""" America's importance?  

No it's just in alphabetical order.

Yes: in the 'Human geography' section, namely the 3rd paragraph.  Other related terms are also treated in that sxn.   | talk | 

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Except of course a real BOOK is not a fictional anything and adding categories for fictional items to articles about real things is nonsensical. So what exactly needs to happen for this article on a real BOOK to not be categorized in fictional categories anymore?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

Your input and feedback is welcomed and encouraged.The Transhumanist    

 Please check and fix the government section 

The government section needs to be checked for accuracy.  The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template, and the data didn't fit all countries.

So those sections need to be looked over, and fixed if needed.

I'd like to fix some details in the italian article, but - as not native english speaker - I need to be sure. This is my question: I suppose that official italian translation is wrong about the lawsuit described in chapter 19.
The original text says They in­sti­tuted a law­suit deny­ing the obli­ga­tion to pay debts to an in­di­vid­ual with a pros­thetic heart... Does this sentence mean: #1 No one is obligated to pay debts to any robot/android OR #2 A robot/android is not obligated to pay debts? #2 is teh italian version, but #1 looks more logical to me because at the end of chapter #17 Andrew says: """"I have been un­der obli­ga­tion to in­di­vid­ual mem­bers of the firm in times past. I am not, now. It is rather the other way around now and I am call­ing in my debts."""" Thanks!   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Does anyone know whether there's anything to the claim that the Millerites (presumably adherents of Millerism) were interested in Cantor's work?  For me, a web search doesn't find much, and one of the things it does find is the same claim in this article from several years back.

So there seem to be several possibilities:
 Just a hoax, with a persistent perpetrator.
 Someone trying to add something he/she thinks is really true, but can't substantiate.
 An actual tidbit about the Millerites, potentially sourceable if we found the right sources.

Now, even in case 3, I kind of doubt it's appropriate for this article, but the matter could be discussed.  (Might be more appropriate at Millerism, which doesn't mention Cantor.)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your Number six is definately a Daffodil and number one and seven are probably Daffodils too. The taxonomy of Daffodils is quite large but they are all of the Narcissus family. Number 8 also could be a Narcissus hybrid. Number two is definately a type of violet (viola genus) the common violet is viola papilionacea but yours is too blue. Number 5 is prolly a forget-me-not (myosotis scorpioides).  Number nine is a wild pansy (Viola tricolor). My mother thinks the number three is a clematis but no confirmation is possible.
